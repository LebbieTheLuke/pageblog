<strong>You are my sunshine <br>
My only sunshine<br>
You make me happy<br>
When skies are gray<br>
You'll never know, dear<br>
How much I love you<br>
Please don't take<br>
My sunshine away<br>
The other night, dear<br>
As I lay sleeping<br>
I dreamed I held you<br>
In my arms<br>
When I awoke, dear
I was mistaken<br>
So I hung my head and cried<br>
You are my sunshine<br>
My only sunshine<br>
You make me happy<br>
When skies are gray<br>
You'll never know, dear<br>
How much I love you<br>
Please don't take<br>
My sunshine away</strong>
